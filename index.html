  <h1>Tom Swifties 10k Project</h1>
  <ol>  
    <li>"Raymond and I have been brothers this whole time?" Tom said brofoundly.</li> 
    <li>"I want to be the very best, like no one ever was." Tom said to the cashier.</li>
    <li>"Ack! Me!" Tom said as he peaked.</li>
    <li>"The goal of this project I am overtaking is to give young men autonomy in a complex world," Tom said agentically.</li>    
    <li>"Tom Swifties all day keep a doctorate away," Tom said with aplomb.</li>
    <li>"The Riddler, Falcone, Penguin, Maroni, Harley Quinn, uh... it still doesn't make sense," Tom said, missing the joke.</li>
    <li>"BWAAAAAAAA," Tom simmered.</li>
    <li>"Is this Last Psychiatrist guy a viking?" Tom said narcissistically.</li>
    <li>"The derivative doesn't– doesn't– it doesn't– uh, exist at this point," Tom said discontinuously.</li>
    <li>"The derivative is zero." Tom said flatly.</li>
    <li>"I write Tom Swifties to cope with the stresses of life, but I know other people have worse ideas." Tom said at the group therapy session, his words lost in the ambient conversation. </li>
    <li>"There is no consensus on what happens when you write ten thousand Tom Swifties, but I have some guesses." Tom said expertly.</li>
    <li>"You always goad me into writing the twelfth hebrew letter before the first," Tom blamed his brother all of a sudden.</li>
    <li>"Oh, right, I forgot – you are actually a part of this organization," Tom remembered.</li>
    <li>"This ground looks like it's great for saplings," Tom said, observing its nutrients.</li>
    <li>"This curry was bland, but then I added some chili powder," Tom explained.</li>
    <li>"If you press that button, you'll be thrown out of the aircraft," Tom explained.</li>
    <li>"Nobody likes my Tom Swifties. By making too many of them, I have become a pariah in my community. I'm going to stop now." Tom said adverblessly.</li>
    <li>"You talk like it's still 2008!" Tom said autistically.</li>
    <li>"Are you seriously proposing a garland that looks like it's been iced over?" Tom said tensely.</li>
    <li>"Explain quantum computing in simple terms. Got any creative ideas for a 10 year old’s birthday? How do I make an HTTP request in Javascript?" Tom said promptly.</li>
    <li>"They told me running on lava was good for your feet," Tom said randomly.</li>
    <li>“Don’t you want to know who the Batman really is?” Tom said, his voice waning.</li>
    <li>“No, really! I can bend all four elements!” Tom said angrily.</li>
    <li>“Who turned the radio on?” Tom said schizophrenically.</li>
    <li>“I’ll meet you at the women’s conference,” Tom galavanted.</li>
    <li>“I only have one intention, but I won’t tell you what it is,” Tom said revealingly.</li>
    <li>“When I read books, I only read the whitespace,” Tom said subtly.</li>
    <li>“Ah!” Tom said, awed.</li>
    <li>“It’s not pronounced like a baby chicken!” Tom said chicly.</li>
    <li>“Man’s greatest calling is to humorously exploit stray connections in language,” Tom puntificated.</li>
    <li>“That’s a barber shop quartet,” Tom said menacingly.</li>
    <li>“I think that’s a new word,” Tom said neologistically.</li>
    <li>“Welcome to the hotel,” Tom said dormantly.</li>
    <li>“You can get the right answer quickly, but I can get the wrong one instantly.” Tom said fastidiously.</li>
    <li>“I think that’s the fastest you can go,” Tom said lightly.</li>
    <li>“Step 1 is to go to step 2, step 2 is to start back at step 1.” Tom said recursively.</li>
    <li>“I hate spikes,” Tom said pointedly.</li>
    <li>“P l e a s e  h e l p  m e  p u t  m y  l e t t e r s  b a c k  t o g e t h e r.” Tom said as he spaced out.</li>
